# Article Cloud

I have used mediastack API call to implement the app, hence I have used "AXIOS"

## BOOTSTRAP| REACTSTRAP| USESTATE| USEEFFECT| REACT ROUTE,SWITCH| PAGINATION all these properties have been used.

Third Party API:

### `mediastack` https://mediastack.com/documentation

How API is used:

When the app loads, it first fetchs the Articles from the API up 25 articles and I have divided it into (25/5 =5) sets
I have destructed the JSON into "title" "description" "image" and a button through which user can add a comment and save it to its "My Collection List"

How the modal is used to share the news via local storage:
### `Using Modal Component to use Share and Add comment feature` https://reactstrap.github.io/components/modals/
Through REACTSTRAP I have use this component.

Later I have saved the shared news with comment in the `Local Storage`
